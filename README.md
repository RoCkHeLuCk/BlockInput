# BlockInput
Bock input your pc.

You can leave your computer screen free to play a video or presentation, lock your mouse and keyboard instead of logging off, and walk around safely. It may allow the use of some keys so that other people can pass, pause or rewind presentations/videos without being able to touch another part of the computer. If you have a WebCam, it takes a picture of whoever is trying to mess with it without permission.
